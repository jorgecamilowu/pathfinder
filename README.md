## Shortest Paths Visualizer

Welcome! I built this project as an exercise to implement some of the data structures and algorithms I learned
in class. Specifically, Dijkstra's shortest path and A\* Search. Both of them use a min binary heap to quickly decide which node to visit next. You can play with the visualizer here: ... enjoy!

### How to use

Drag and drop FTW!: You can re-assign the source and target nodes by simply drag and dropping them to wherever you like.

Add walls: simply click and drag the nodes you wish to assign as walls.

Add weights: turn the switch "Add weight" switch on and simply click and drag the nodes you wish to assign as weighted. Weighted nodes are 5 times slower than un-weighted ones, so both algorithms are heavily encouraged to avoiding them as much as possible.

You can also have the application randomly assign walls and weights by clicking "Generate Random Walls" and "Generate Random Weights"!

Lastly, to run the visualizer choose between "Run Dijkstra" or "Run A\* Search"

Note that you will need to clear the board after running the algorihm if you want to modify the walls/weights!
